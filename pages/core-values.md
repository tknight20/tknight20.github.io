# **Core Values**

## **Work Hard, Have Fun**

#### **"Work Hard, Have Fun"** comes from a phrase one of my engineering professors said all the time. He said it to emphasize the importance of doing good work while also having fun at the same time. I have used this as a guiding principle to most work I do and it has served me well to help me decide my path in life.


## **Work with Integrity**

#### I always strive to do my work and live my life the right way, even if it's harder and takes longer. I believe that dishonest work is worse than no work at all and that cutting corners is never the answer. This value has allowed me to take pride in my work and its quality.


## **Give Glory to God**

#### When making important decisions or even when doing my work, I keep this value in my mind and ask myself if I am truly giving God the glory. It has helped to guide my actions and decisions and has kept my work grounded in my faith, which I believe is very important.
